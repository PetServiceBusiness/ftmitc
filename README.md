# find the monster in the closet
OVERVIEW:

you are trying to find the monster in the closet so you dont have to be scared of it during the night. fortunately, the monster's movement is random. unfortunately, you're blind and you only know where you are due to your incredible ability to know how a grid works. cool right?

HOW TO PLAY:

go to the exact coordinates as the monster is. going up and down increases and decreases the y position (or the second coordinate) respectively, and right and left increases and decreases the x position (or the first coordinate) also respectively. that's how a grid works i shouldnt have to explain this
anyways the monster moves around so you have to predict where it is going to go.
